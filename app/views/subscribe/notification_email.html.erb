<p>Hi there!</p>

<p>Thanks for trying out my free prototype to help you borrow what you need. I'm offering this no-strings-attached service to better study the sharing economy. If you have any thoughts you want to directly share, please respond to this email. At times, I may send you an email reminder to borrow when I get new inventory or a holiday weekend is coming up. If you'd rather not receive these, reply and let me know as well.</p>

<p>Thanks and happy borrowing!</p>

<p>James</p>
