    <p>Woohoo, now you get to tell us what you need! Please keep in mind:</p>
    <ul style="font-size:90%;">
    <li><b>Once you submit</b> we'll send an email to all the lenders who have the item(s) you want <b>in your county</b> (note that most of our lenders are in San Francisco), and connect you with whoever 'accepts' first.
    <li>If you request multiple items, it is likely that you'll have to coordinate with multiple lenders</li>
    <li>We recommend submitting a request <b>1-2 weeks in advance</b> with an extra <b>"buffer" day</b> on each end. It may be difficult for lenders to respond to same day requests</li>
